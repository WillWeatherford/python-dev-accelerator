    This document contains no slides.

If you don't already have a blog where you can write on technical topics, set
one up, and connect it to a domain name you own. It's entirely possible your
learning journal could be such a blog, assuming you are okay with people seeing
it.

If not, an easy path to setting up a blog is to sign up with `tumblr`_ and then
set up a `custom domain name`_. Another popular (and perhaps more Pythonic)
approach is to use Pelican in combination with `github pages`_. The
possibilities are nearly endless.

Write titles and at least three paragraph headers/bullet points for 3 to 5
possible blog post ideas. Start thinking about which one you like best.

Copy/paste your rough outlines in as text OR submit a link to the outlines (in
workflowy, a gist or google docs). Do one or the other, not both.

For the peer review portion of the assignment, give some feedback on the topic
selections and the headers. How can the titles be more interesting to you?
