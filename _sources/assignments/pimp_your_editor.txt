As a developer, your text editor is your primary tool.  It is well worth your
while to take the time to make it your friend.

Tasks
=====

Read :doc:`the assignment text </readings/sublime_as_ide>` to get some ideas about
how you can improve your text editor.  If you are not a Sublime Text user,
consider it a challenge to learn how to make similar improvements to your
editor of choice.

Complete the enhancements listed by the deadline.

In addition, see if you can find a few other add-ons that you find useful.  Try
to install them and configure them.

Searching online for "editor enhancements for python development" can be of
help in brainstorming.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Submit screenshots of your editor showing the enhancements you've made.  In
particular, style linting is crucial.

Use the comments feature to add questions, comments, and reflections on what
you learned.  Especially if you find any nifty plugins or enhancements you want
to share with the class.
