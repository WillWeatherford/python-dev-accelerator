===============================
Python Learning Journal: Step 4
===============================

We haven't been able to truly persist our Learning Journals on our Heroku deployment.
Let's change that today.

Tasks
=====

Create a new branch (``step4``) for today's work. 
Do your work on this branch.

Using what you learned today, both in class and in your readings, accomplish the following tasks for your learning journal along with your partner:

* Add the `PostgreSQL service <https://www.heroku.com/postgres>`_ to your Heroku deployment.
* Clean up the styling and structure of your app.

Your code should be *thoroughly* tested. 
Write unit tests of the view functions themselves, unit tests for your models, and *functional* tests that show the configured system works properly.

You are working with a partner to complete this application.

When all of the above work is completed, update your deployment to Heroku. 
Make sure to include the URL to your Heroku deployment in your ``README.md`` file. 
Update your ``README.md`` to include the coverage output of your tests for Python 2 **and** Python 3 for this branch.
You should have coverage reports for steps 1, 2, and 3 in your ``README.md``.

Submitting Your work
====================

When your work is done and your site is deployed, push all of your work to your GitHub repo. 
Open a new pull request from the ``step4`` branch to ``master``. 
Submit the URL of that pull request to Canvas.

Finally, merge your pull request to prepare for the work in `Python Learning Journal: Step 5 <pyramid_lj_5.html>`_

Use the comment feature in canvas to submit the following:

* At least one well-formed question about the work you did for this assignment
* At least one comment on what went well
* At least one comment on what was particularly difficult or challenging
