community.

Tasks
=====

* If you don't already have a Twitter account, set one up.
* Add a nice or interesting photo of your lovely face
* Practice "mentioning" another user. Not sure what to say? Try tweeting
  something about Code Fellows, using the CF handle: @CodeFellowsOrg
* Follow @CodeFellowsOrg, @crisewing, & your classmates. Twitter will then
  suggest a number of other interesting accounts.
