<div><p>&#8220;David Kolb identified four types activities in the adult education process
that must all be performed to achieve true understanding: Concrete
Experience -&gt; Reflective Observation -&gt; Abstract Conceptualization -&gt;
Active Experimentation. Each stage is mutually supportive of and feeds into
the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it
through around the circle.&#8221;</p>

<li><p class="first">Best practices</p>
<p>Learning to program in Python is about more than just learning logic,
algorithms and data structures.  It&#8217;s about learning to write idiomatic
Python.  Python lends itself to clear, expressive programs, and learning to
write the most pythonic Python will result in programs that are clean and
easy to understand.  But more than that, idiomatic Python is Python that
operates to the strengths of the language. Throughout the course, an
emphasis will be placed on writing truly pythonic Python, and on learning
to evaluate what is pythonic.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">BDD</p>
<p>Behavior Driven Development outlines an application&#8217;s expected features and
functionality first, before the coding begins. As Dan North says &#8220;Behavior
is a more useful word than test&#8221;. Focusing on the behavior of an
application reduces question of what to test, what to call the tests, and
which things to test.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Paths and Sandboxes</p>
<p>&#8220;A path is a prescribed series of steps that get completed one after
another. It&#8217;s your classic tutorial. A sandbox is a collaborative learning
space that values exploration, play, and generating autonomy.  While there
are many paths to Python learning online, it&#8217;s harder to provide a great
example of a sandbox. That is why we are gathered here together in person
at this Code Fellows Bootcamp. It&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t focus on creating yet
another path for you to follow. &#8220;</p>

<div class="section" id="the-honor-code">
<h3>The Honor Code:<a class="headerlink" href="#the-honor-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As members of the Code Fellows community, each of us upholds and supports a
high standard of personal, and community, honesty and integrity.  We believe
these values are critical to a community dedicated to learning, personal
development, and a search for understanding. We consider them essential in
promoting personal responsibility, moral and intellectual leadership, and pride
in ourselves and our organization.</p>
<p>Therefore, each of us agrees to represent ourselves truthfully, claim only work
that is our own, properly attribute collaborations, and engage honestly in all
assignments.  Moreover, each of us shares the responsibility for encouraging
and reinforcing the importance of integrity in other community members.
Members of the Code Fellows community who misrepresent themselves or their work
through cheating, fabrication, facilitation, plagiarism, etc, or who suspect
another of such misrepresentation are expected to follow the Reporting
Procedures outlined. Code Fellows instructors and leaders reserve the right to
remove any students or graduates who fail to live up to these standards from
bootcamps, classes, or other parts of community membership, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Consistent with the basic expectations of the Honor Code, students who believe
they may have violated Code Fellows’ standards of integrity are expected to
acknowledge their concerns to the instructor in the class or to Code Fellows
staff.  Moreover, a student who observes what may be any dishonest behavior on
the part of another student is expected to share that concern with the student
immediately. At that point, if either student believes that an Honor Code
violation may have occurred, the student observed is expected to self-report
the incident immediately to the instructor in the class or to his or her or
administrative adviser. Self-reporting does not constitute an admission of
guilt but is an essential step, necessary to prevent misunderstanding and
apprehensions. Within three class days, the observer will also contact a member
of Code Fellows management to insure that the self-report has indeed taken
place. The instructor will review the elements of the complaint, and if the
instructor believes that the Honor Code has been violated, he or she will
contact a member of Code Fellows management, who will take appropriate action.</p>

<h3>Diversity and Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-and-equality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a hater, we are all here in this together, and want to create a
welcoming environment for everyone here. A Code Fellow works to widen access to
computer science education and ensure it is open to all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="non-discrimination-policy">
<h3>Non-discrimination policy:<a class="headerlink" href="#non-discrimination-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a part of our honor code, in order to maintain personal and communal
integrity, Code Fellows is committed to the principle that all persons shall
have equal access to programs, facilities, services, and employment without
regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance, or
qualifications as determined by Code Fellows policy and/or applicable laws.</p>
<p>Code Fellows prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying against any
person because of age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, national
origin, race, religion, gender, sexual or affectional orientation, gender
identity, appearance, matriculation, political affiliation, marital status,
veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law.  Code Fellows
expects that its students, employees, volunteers, members, and other
constituents of Code Fellows, when and where ever those individuals are
conducting Code Fellows business or participating in Code Fellows classes,
events, or activities, shall maintain an environment free of discrimination,
including harassment, bullying, or retaliation.</p>

<h2>Pre-Work<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The 401 Python class moves fast through a large quantity of material.
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills you&#8217;ll be using every day is vital to your success.</p>
<p>From the pre-work assignments below, please select the area in which you are the weakest.
Begin by working on that.
Once you have spent at least 10 hours on that area, select your next weakest area and move on to that.</p>
<p>You do not need to do a lot of work every day.
One hour is enough, though just.
The key is to work every single day.
Do not let a day go by without spending your time practicing.</p>
