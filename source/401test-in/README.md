### Guidelines

- You do not need to use any Javascript for this project. You can if you want to, but it is not required.
- You can replace the cat images with whatever you want. Placeholder images are fine. These images came from [placekitty](http://www.placekitten.com)
- You can replace the page text with whatever you want, however keep the subject matter throughout the site self-consistent.
- Any anchors that would lead to external pages (e.g. social media sites) should just remain as either dead links (so, link to "#") or simply to the homepages of those sites (e.g. Facebook icon links to facebook.com)
- You don't have to use the same exact social media icons used here, but they should be the same brands
- The Contact form shouldn't actually submit data to anything
