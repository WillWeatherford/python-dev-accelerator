There are a number of ways we will communicate during class.  The primary
channel will be Slack.  A solid secondary channel (and one you should be
comfortable using) is IRC

Slack
=====

You should have received an invitation to join the Code Fellows Slack
community.  Make sure you can connect and interact.  Take the time to set up
your personal preferences so that you get notifications.  You will also want to
set your email preferences to allow you to hear about it when you are notified
even if you aren't logged in.  Make sure you join the class channel (the course
number is the channel name)

IRC
===

Inernet Relay Chat (IRC) despite being an ancient chat protocol, is a primary
communications and support channel throughout the open source community. It's
important that you're familiar with it and can utilize it for help and to
connect with others in the community.

If you do not already have one, obtain and install an IRC client.

For the Mac, best free client is `LimeChat`_. Other options include `Textual`_
or `Colloquy`_.

.. _Textual: https://www.codeux.com/textual/
.. _Colloquy: http://colloquy.info/

On Unix, your package manager should have `XChat`_ or `Pidgin`_.

.. _XChat: http://xchat.org/
.. _Pidgin: https://www.pidgin.im/

Connect to the class IRC channel (#codefellows on freenode.net) and say hello.

It's a good idea to register a nickname with Freenode. Registered nicknames are
required for certain channels (like #python), and a stable nickname helps build
reputation over time. Type /msg NickServ help to get started from your IRC
client.

http://www.irchelp.org/ is a great intro site if you're new to IRC

Submitting Your Work
====================

There is no submission for this assignment. We'll see you on the #codefellows
channel in IRC and in the class channel in Slack. It's very useful for sending
links to everyone during class.
