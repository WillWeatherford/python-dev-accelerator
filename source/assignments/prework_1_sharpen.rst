To help ease yourself into the experience it is important that you start limbering up your Python muscles.
Be sure to spend at least one or two hours each day writing Python code.
What you write is not as important as generally exercising your skills in thinking in Python.

If you are brand new to python, begin with one of the learning resources listed here.
