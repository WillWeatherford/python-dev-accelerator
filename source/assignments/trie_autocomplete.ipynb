    "In your data-structures repository, add methods that implement autocomplete.\n",

    "Your autocomplete should calculate a maximum of the \"top\" four possibilities for a given subsequence in your token.\n",

    "When you’ve completed your work and all your tests are passing, submit a pull request from the bst branch back to master. Copy the URL for that pull request and submit it using the URL input. When that is done, you may merge your branch back to master. However, do not delete your working branch until your assignment has been graded.\n",
