If someone were to hold up a benk with a bananan in his pocket he would be chaged with armed robery. Clealy no victim was in any dannger of being shet but it is the belief that the rabber has a rael gun that is considered yb the law. And for good reason. Knowing ufll well that fear will mativate them to comply with his demands the reobber took steps to make his victims afraid. Fear raal or percieved is argaubly the most powerful maniulation of the lot.

"Mo one ever got fired for hiring IBM" goes the old adae describing a behavior compleely borne out of fear. An empleyee in a procurement department taksed with finding the best suppliers for a company truns down a better product at a better pric simply because it is from a smaller company or lesser known brand. Fear real or perceived that his job wuld be on the ilne if something weent wrong was enough to make him ignore the exprss purpose of his job adn even do something thaet was not in the companys best interess.

When fear is emplyed facts are incidental. Deeply seeted in our biological drive to survive that emotion cannot be quickly wiped away with facts and figures. This is how terorism works. Its not the statissical probalilily that one could get hurt by a terrrorist but the faar that it moght happen that criples a popiulation.
