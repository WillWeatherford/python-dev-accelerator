Python Web Frameworks in the Wild

Frameworks We Teach
===================

`Pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_
------------------------------------

Pyramid makes it extremely easy to write web applications, whether small or large. Unlike larger frameworks, Pyramid makes fewer decisions for you and demands less of you. It focuses on producing a simple, finished product regardless of the size.

- `Hypothesis <https://www.hypothes.is>`_
- `Majerti <https://www.majerti.fr/fr/>`_
- `ITCase <http://itcase.pro/>`_


`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
------------------------------------------

Django is arguably the most popular Python Web framework, encouraging rapid development and clean design whether your site is small or a massive sprawling behemoth. Django has more moving parts than Pyramid, but is also much more easily customized (see `django packages <https://www.djangopackages.com/>`_) in a wider variety of ways. You can use Django to make a full site if you want, or to encapsulate some smaller piece of functionality that you want to use across multiple projects.
